I am a PhD researcher within the Water & Climate Risk group of the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In particular, I do my research part of the [Climate Extremes](https://climateextremes.eu/) and [Hydrological Extremes](https://hydrologicalextremes.org/) groups lead by Dim Coumou and Anne Van Loon respectively. I study weather and climate extremes and related impacts on the agricultural sector. In specific, I apply data-driven approaches to assess the impacts of local and spatially compound hazard events affecting global hotspot producing regions. Moreover, I focus on the storyline approach to address low probability, high impact events both under current and future climate change conditions. My current research is embedded within [RECEIPT](https://climatestorylines.eu/), an EU-funded project on climate risk storylines. Before starting at the VU Amsterdam, I worked for the environmental consultancy company [FutureWater](http://futurewater.eu/). My main task focused on the EU-funded project [IMPREX](https://www.imprex.eu/) where I analyzed process-based and data-driven seasonal forecasting skill of hydrological and crop-related variables for a specific region in the South East of Spain.
